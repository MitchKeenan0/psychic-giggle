QA Engineering Challenge

A C# script that can open up a text file, 
and tell us the number that has repeated 
the fewest number of times.

HOW TO USE:
The QA_ENGNR_GetLeastRepeatingNumberFromFileTxt folder contains a VisualStudio project.
Contained within this folder/project is the Program.cs file which will do the work.
Run Program.cs which will open a cmd window and provide a prompt to begin.

Copy the desired folder or file's full path to your clipboard.
Providing a folder will automatically run for all files contained within.

Enjoy the sweet, sweet data.
