QA Engineering Challenge - 
a C# script that can open up a text file, 
and tell us the number that has repeated 
the fewest number of times.

HOW TO USE:
Copy the desired folder or file's full path to your clipboard.
Run the program, and paste the file path in the prompt.
Enjoy the sweet, sweet data.
